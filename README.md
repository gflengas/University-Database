# University-Database
The database will contain all the data related to a university department and its operation. For this database, the ER diagram, PostgreSQL relational implementation, and initial data were provided. 

An external application for the export of indicative functionality and communication with the PostgreSQL database management system using JDBC protocol was also build.
